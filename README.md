# lisp-rs

A simple Lisp interpreter in Rust. The interpreter was initially developed as a **teaching aid** to explain how Lisp interpreters work and how can they be implemented using the Rust programming language. However now the interpreter seems to be taking life of it's own and has been ported to the [web](https://vishpat.github.io/lisp-rs-wasm) using [WASM](https://webassembly.org).

## Dialect
The interpreter is based on a modified subset of [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)). More information about the dialect can be found at

- [Syntax](https://github.com/vishpat/lisp-rs/wiki/Lisp-Syntax)
- [Sample Programs](https://github.com/vishpat/lisp-rs/wiki/Sample-programs)

## Implementation

The interpreter has been implemented in three phases

- Phase I: Complete interpreter and REPL implementation with support for basic data types (integers and boolean), variables, lambdas, and lambda calls (branch 0.0.1)
- Phase II: Support for advanced data types (string, float, and lists) and functional constructs (branch 0.0.2)
- Phase III: Support for tail call optimization (branch 0.0.3) and closures (branch 0.0.4)


For a detailed code-walkthrough about Phase-I implementation refer to the [docs](https://vishpat.github.io/lisp-rs). For code-walkthrough of all the phases, get the [e-book](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B1Z48DMT/ref=cm_sw_r_apan_QD16PC5E2EZWMKB1EZMK).

## REPL
```
cargo run --features="build-binary"
```

## Test
```
cargo test
```

## WASM

The interpreter has also been compiled to WASM so that it can run in a browser and is hosted [here](https://vishpat.github.io/lisp-rs-wasm).
